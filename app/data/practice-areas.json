        {
          "q": "What is the difference between assault and domestic assault?",
          "a": "Domestic assault involves family or household members, which often results in immediate arrest and automatic no-contact orders. Though the legal elements are similar, domestic cases carry additional restrictions that impact home life, employment, and firearm rights."
        },
        {
          "q": "What penalties could I face?",
          "a": "Penalties depend on the degree of assault. Fifth-degree assault (misdemeanor) carries up to 90 days in jail, while first-degree assault (felony) can result in up to 20 years in prison. The severity hinges on the level of harm, the use of a weapon, and the status of the alleged victim."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if I acted in self-defense?",
          "a": "Self-defense is one of the most common and strongest defenses to assault charges. If you reasonably believed harm was coming to you or someone else, your actions may be legally justified. Andrew will evaluate all evidence to determine whether self-defense applies."
        },
        {
          "q": "How does a no-contact order work?",
          "a": "A no-contact order prohibits any communication with the protected person. Only a judge can lift the order—even if the other person invites contact. Any violation can lead to additional criminal charges."
        },
        {
          "q": "Should I talk to police before hiring a lawyer?",
          "a": "No. Assault cases are highly emotional, and statements can easily be misinterpreted. Always speak with a lawyer before giving any statement to police."

A low-level possession case may carry the possibility of diversion or probation, while higher-degree controlled substance crimes can involve years in prison, heavy fines, forfeiture of property, and a permanent felony record."

Because the decision to test or refuse has serious consequences, it’s critical to understand your rights as early as possible."

  "faqTitle": "Minnesota Expungement FAQ",
  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is an expungement in Minnesota?",
      "a": "An expungement is a court order sealing your criminal record from public view. It does not physically destroy the record, but it removes it from most background checks and generally means you no longer have to disclose it on job or housing applications unless specifically required by law."
    },
    {
      "q": "If I was arrested but never charged, can I get an expungement?",
      "a": "Often, yes. If you were arrested but never formally charged—or if charges were dismissed early in the process—you may qualify for a full expungement. This can include sealing records and requiring agencies to return or seal fingerprints, booking photos, and other identifying information."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I get an expungement if I was convicted?",
      "a": "In many cases, yes. Minnesota law allows expungement of certain convictions if you have remained law-abiding for a required period of time after completing your sentence, including probation. The waiting period is generally two years for petty misdemeanors and misdemeanors, four years for gross misdemeanors, and five years for many felonies. Not all felonies are eligible, and an attorney can help you review your options."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does an expungement erase my record completely?",
      "a": "No. The record typically still exists but is sealed from public access. Certain government agencies may still be able to view the record under limited circumstances, but employers, landlords, and most background checks will no longer see it."
    },
    {
      "q": "How long does the expungement process take?",
      "a": "Most expungement cases take several months. The process includes drafting a detailed petition, notifying all agencies that hold your records, attending a court hearing, and waiting for the court’s decision and appeal period. Timelines can vary by county and by the specific facts of your case."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What does “implied consent” mean in Minnesota?",
      "a": "Minnesota is an implied consent state. By driving on Minnesota roads, you are legally considered to have given your consent to a breath, blood, or urine test if law enforcement has probable cause to believe you are impaired. Refusing that test can itself be a separate crime and can trigger license consequences."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can I be charged with both DWI and test refusal?",
      "a": "Yes. Test refusal is its own crime under Minnesota Statute § 169A.51. If you refuse the test and are also alleged to have driven while impaired, you can face two separate charges: one for the DWI and one for the refusal."
    },
    {
      "q": "What are the penalties for refusing a breath test?",
      "a": "A criminal test refusal is a gross misdemeanor in many cases and can carry up to one year in jail, a fine of up to $3,000, and significant driver’s license consequences. The exact penalties depend on your prior record and other factors, which is why it is critical to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible."
    },
    {
      "q": "Are blood and urine test refusals treated the same as breath test refusals?",
      "a": "Not exactly. Changes in the law, driven in part by decisions from the United States Supreme Court, limit when the state can criminalize refusal of a warrantless blood test. In many situations, officers must obtain a warrant before demanding a blood sample. The rules for breath tests and blood/urine tests are different and continue to evolve, which is why these cases require close legal analysis."
    },
    {
      "q": "Does a test refusal automatically mean I lose my license?",
      "a": "A refusal almost always triggers separate driver’s license consequences under the civil implied consent process, which can include longer revocation periods than a simple DWI. However, you may have the right to challenge the revocation in court. Andrew can help you understand deadlines and options for fighting the license side of your case."

The test is treated as a legal “search,” and refusing that search can itself be a crime. In many cases, the officer does not need a warrant for a breath test but may need one for blood or urine, depending on the situation and current law. The result is a complicated mix of criminal charges and civil license penalties that can be overwhelming without experienced legal help."

Following decisions from the United States Supreme Court, it is unconstitutional in many situations to criminalize refusal of a warrantless blood test. As a result, for incidents after July 1, 2017, officers typically must choose: either offer a breath test and pursue refusal charges if you decline, or obtain a search warrant for a blood sample. These distinctions matter.

    },
    {
      "q": "What can happen at a probation violation or revocation hearing?",
      "a": "At a violation hearing, the judge reviews the probation officer’s report and any evidence about the alleged violation. The judge can dismiss the violation, give you another chance with modified conditions, or revoke probation and impose some or all of the jail or prison time that was previously stayed. Because judges have wide discretion, having a defense lawyer is critical."

    {
      "q": "What is the burden of proof for a probation violation?",

    },
    {
      "q": "Can one violation send me to jail?",
      "a": "Yes, it can. Sometimes judges give people another chance, especially on a first or minor violation. In other cases—such as repeated violations, new offenses, or serious non-compliance—the judge may revoke probation and order you to serve some or all of the suspended sentence. The outcome often depends on how the violation is explained and what plan is presented to the court."

Still serious, but carries the lowest maximum jail time.\n• **Fourth Degree CSC** – Typically involves sexual contact (not penetration) with an adult or minor under circumstances such as mental impairment, physical helplessness (including sleeping or unconscious), force or coercion, or a prohibited relationship (therapist, clergy, caregiver, position of authority).\n• **Third Degree CSC** – Involves sexual penetration under circumstances similar to Fourth Degree: force or coercion, mental impairment, physical helplessness, certain age differences with minors, or prohibited relationships.\n• **Second Degree CSC** – Involves sexual contact where aggravating factors are present, such as a dangerous weapon, threats of imminent great bodily harm, force with personal injury, or an accomplice.\n• **First Degree CSC** – The most serious charge, often involving sexual penetration with minors under certain ages, use of weapons, force or threats of serious harm, personal injury, or an accomplice. Penalties can reach up to 30 years in prison and very large fines.\n\nWhich degree is charged depends on the specific facts, ages, relationships, methods alleged, and any aggravating factors."

      "a": "Theft in Minnesota covers a wide range of conduct: shoplifting, taking someone else’s property without permission, writing bad checks, using someone’s services without paying, embezzling funds from an employer, receiving stolen property, motor vehicle theft, and more. Burglary and robbery are related but involve entering buildings or using force."
    },
    {
      "q": "When does theft become a felony in Minnesota?",
      "a": "Generally, when the value of the property or money is $1,000 or more, the state can charge felony theft. As the dollar amount goes up, so do the potential penalties. Certain types of property, prior theft convictions, or aggravating circumstances can also elevate the charge."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the difference between theft, burglary, and robbery?",
      "a": "Theft usually involves taking property without consent. Burglary typically means entering a building without permission with the intent to commit a crime inside. Robbery involves taking property from a person using force or the threat of force. All are serious, but burglary and robbery charges often carry higher penalties."
    },
    {
      "q": "Will a theft conviction stay on my record?",
      "a": "Yes. Theft crimes are crimes of dishonesty and can create long-term problems for employment, housing, loans, and professional licenses. Even lower-level shoplifting convictions can make background checks difficult. In some cases, there may be options down the road for expungement, but it is always better to avoid a conviction if possible."

  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "Can a traffic ticket really affect my criminal record?",
      "a": "Yes. While some traffic tickets are minor, others carry misdemeanor or even gross misdemeanor penalties that can leave a permanent criminal record. Even simple citations can increase insurance rates or lead to license suspension if too many accumulate."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I do if my license was revoked or suspended?",
      "a": "Do not drive. Driving after revocation, suspension, or cancellation is a criminal offense in Minnesota. Contact a defense attorney to help resolve the issue and work toward getting your driving privileges restored."
    },
    {
      "q": "Can a lawyer help me avoid insurance increases?",
      "a": "Often, yes. By getting charges reduced, avoiding convictions, or challenging the underlying evidence, we can frequently prevent insurance spikes or keep violations off your driving record."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is speeding over 100 MPH really that serious?",
      "a": "Yes. Speeding over 100 MPH triggers an automatic license revocation in Minnesota and can result in significant fines, probation, or even jail time. Strong legal representation is crucial."
    },
    {
      "q": "Should I contest a ticket if no one was hurt?",
      "a": "In many cases, yes. Even minor violations can compound into major problems, including insurance increases or a suspended license. Fighting the ticket now can save significant time and money later."

  "faqTitle": "Criminal Vehicular Homicide FAQ",
  "faq": [
    {
      "q": "What is criminal vehicular homicide in Minnesota?",
      "a": "Criminal vehicular homicide generally involves causing the death of another person while operating a motor vehicle in a criminally negligent manner or while committing certain offenses, such as driving while impaired (DWI), leaving the scene of a crash, or grossly disregarding the safety of others. The exact definition and elements depend on the specific statute charged."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is criminal vehicular homicide the same as murder?",
      "a": "No. Criminal vehicular homicide is a separate offense that specifically involves the operation of a motor vehicle. It is still a very serious felony that can result in substantial prison time and long-term consequences, but it is distinct from intentional homicide or murder charges."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do I automatically go to prison if I am charged?",
      "a": "A charge is not a conviction. While criminal vehicular homicide carries the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence, the outcome depends on the facts of your case, your prior record, how the incident is charged, and the strength of your defense. An experienced defense lawyer can often make a significant difference in the result."
    },
    {
      "q": "How does DWI affect a criminal vehicular homicide case?",
      "a": "Allegations of driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs often play a central role in criminal vehicular homicide charges. The state may rely on breath, blood, or urine test results, officer observations, and field sobriety tests. These tests and procedures can be challenged if they were not done correctly or if your rights were violated."
    },
    {
      "q": "What should I do if I am being investigated after a fatal crash?",
      "a": "Do not discuss the incident with law enforcement, insurance companies, or anyone else about what happened before speaking with an attorney. Anything you say may be used against you later. Contact a criminal defense lawyer immediately to protect your rights and guide you through the investigation."
