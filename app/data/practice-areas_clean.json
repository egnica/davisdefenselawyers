        {
          "q": "What is the difference between assault and domestic assault?",
          "a": "Domestic assault involves family or household members, which often results in immediate arrest and automatic no-contact orders. Though the legal elements are similar, domestic cases carry additional restrictions that impact home life, employment, and firearm rights."
        },
        {
          "q": "What penalties could I face?",
          "a": "Penalties depend on the degree of assault. Fifth-degree assault (misdemeanor) carries up to 90 days in jail, while first-degree assault (felony) can result in up to 20 years in prison. The severity hinges on the level of harm, the use of a weapon, and the status of the alleged victim."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if I acted in self-defense?",
          "a": "Self-defense is one of the most common and strongest defenses to assault charges. If you reasonably believed harm was coming to you or someone else, your actions may be legally justified. Andrew will evaluate all evidence to determine whether self-defense applies."
        },
        {
          "q": "How does a no-contact order work?",
          "a": "A no-contact order prohibits any communication with the protected person. Only a judge can lift the order even if the other person invites contact. Any violation can lead to additional criminal charges."
        },
        {
          "q": "Should I talk to police before hiring a lawyer?",
          "a": "No. Assault cases are highly emotional, and statements can easily be misinterpreted. Always speak with a lawyer before giving any statement to police."

A low-level possession case may carry the possibility of diversion or probation, while higher-degree controlled substance crimes can involve years in prison, heavy fines, forfeiture of property, and a permanent felony record."

You can be charged with DWI if drugs illegal substances, prescription medications, or a combination of substances impact your ability to drive safely. Unlike alcohol, which is often measured with a roadside breath test, drug-related DWI cases rely heavily on blood or urine testing and the officer’s observations. These tests must be properly administered, stored, and documented. Andrew carefully reviews the circumstances of your stop, the officer’s training, and the handling of any chemical tests to identify weaknesses in the state’s case."

Many first-time DWIs are misdemeanors, but the consequences quickly escalate with prior offenses, high test results, or aggravating factors such as a child in the vehicle. Multiple DWIs within a ten-year period, or a prior felony DWI, can lead to felony-level charges with the possibility of years in prison, large fines, and loss of firearm rights. If your case involves injury, criminal vehicular operation or homicide charges may also be filed. Early, skilled representation is critical when the stakes are this high."

          "a": "An expungement is a court order sealing your criminal record from public view. It does not physically destroy the record, but it removes it from most background checks and generally means you no longer have to disclose it on job or housing applications unless specifically required by law."

        {
          "q": "If I was arrested but never charged, can I get an expungement?",
          "a": "Often, yes. If you were arrested but never formally charged or if charges were dismissed early in the process you may qualify for a full expungement. This can include sealing records and requiring agencies to return or seal fingerprints, booking photos, and other identifying information."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I get an expungement if I was convicted?",
          "a": "In many cases, yes. Minnesota law allows expungement of certain convictions if you have remained law-abiding for a required period of time after completing your sentence, including probation. The waiting period is generally two years for petty misdemeanors and misdemeanors, four years for gross misdemeanors, and five years for many felonies. Not all felonies are eligible, and an attorney can help you review your options."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does an expungement erase my record completely?",
          "a": "No. The record typically still exists but is sealed from public access. Certain government agencies may still be able to view the record under limited circumstances, but employers, landlords, and most background checks will no longer see it."
        },
        {
          "q": "How long does the expungement process take?",

        {
          "q": "What does “implied consent” mean in Minnesota?",
          "a": "Minnesota is an implied consent state. By driving on Minnesota roads, you are legally considered to have given your consent to a breath, blood, or urine test if law enforcement has probable cause to believe you are impaired. Refusing that test can itself be a separate crime and can trigger license consequences."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I be charged with both DWI and test refusal?",
          "a": "Yes. Test refusal is its own crime under Minnesota Statute § 169A.51. If you refuse the test and are also alleged to have driven while impaired, you can face two separate charges: one for the DWI and one for the refusal."
        },
        {
          "q": "What are the penalties for refusing a breath test?",
          "a": "A criminal test refusal is a gross misdemeanor in many cases and can carry up to one year in jail, a fine of up to $3,000, and significant driver’s license consequences. The exact penalties depend on your prior record and other factors, which is why it is critical to speak with a lawyer as soon as possible."

          "q": "Are blood and urine test refusals treated the same as breath test refusals?",
          "a": "Not exactly. Changes in the law, driven in part by decisions from the United States Supreme Court, limit when the state can criminalize refusal of a warrantless blood test. In many situations, officers must obtain a warrant before demanding a blood sample. The rules for breath tests and blood/urine tests are different and continue to evolve, which is why these cases require close legal analysis."
        },
        {
          "q": "Does a test refusal automatically mean I lose my license?",

However, you may have the right to challenge the revocation in court. Andrew can help you understand deadlines and options for fighting the license side of your case."

The test is treated as a legal “search,” and refusing that search can itself be a crime. In many cases, the officer does not need a warrant for a breath test but may need one for blood or urine, depending on the situation and current law.

          "a": "Sex offenses include a wide range of allegations: rape, sexual assault, criminal sexual conduct (1st–5th degree), child molestation, statutory rape, solicitation of a minor, indecent exposure, possession or distribution of child pornography, prostitution, and solicitation of prostitution. The exact charge depends on factors like age, alleged conduct, use of force, and relationship between the parties."

        {
          "q": "I was falsely accused. Do I really need a lawyer?",
          "a": "Yes. False allegations happen for many reasons revenge, custody disputes, misinterpretation of consensual encounters, or pressure on a complaining witness. Once an accusation is made, police and prosecutors move quickly. Anything you say on your own can be used against you. Having a lawyer early in the process is often the best way to protect yourself and correct the record."

You may also face sex offender treatment, restrictions on where you can live or work, and serious damage to your reputation and relationships."

          "q": "What are the degrees of criminal sexual conduct?",
          "a": "Minnesota has five degrees of Criminal Sexual Conduct (CSC). First Degree is the most serious and can involve sexual penetration with a minor or with an adult under circumstances like force, weapons, or severe injury. Fifth Degree is still serious, but carries the lowest maximum penalty. The degree charged depends on factors like age, whether the conduct was contact or penetration, use of force, alleged mental or physical helplessness, and any position of authority or significant relationship."

        {
          "q": "What is “interference with a 911 call” in Minnesota?",
          "a": "Interference with a 911 call generally means intentionally blocking or interrupting someone’s attempt to contact emergency services. This can include grabbing a phone, hanging up, breaking the phone, hiding it, or threatening someone to stop them from calling 911 during an emergency situation."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is interference with a 911 call a felony?",
          "a": "In most cases, interference with a 911 call is charged as a gross misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a fine up to $3,000. Depending on the circumstances and accompanying charges, the overall exposure in your case can be much higher."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I be charged even if no one was hurt?",
          "a": "Yes. You can be charged with interference with a 911 call even if no one is injured and even if no assault charge is filed. Prosecutors often add this charge when police respond to domestic calls or disputes, even where the underlying incident is minor or disputed."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if I only took the phone for a second or hung up once?",
          "a": "The law focuses on intent. If the state claims you intentionally interfered with someone’s attempt to call for help, they may still file charges. A defense lawyer can argue that any interference was accidental, brief, or not intended to stop a legitimate emergency call."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do I need a lawyer if it’s “just” a gross misdemeanor?",
          "a": "Yes. A gross misdemeanor still carries up to a year in jail, thousands of dollars in fines, and a permanent criminal record. Because interference with a 911 call is often tied to domestic allegations, it can also affect no-contact orders, housing, employment, and family court issues."

      "faq": [
        {
          "q": "What is criminal vehicular homicide in Minnesota?",
          "a": "Criminal vehicular homicide generally involves causing the death of another person while operating a motor vehicle in a criminally negligent manner or while committing certain offenses, such as driving while impaired (DWI), leaving the scene of a crash, or grossly disregarding the safety of others. The exact definition and elements depend on the specific statute charged."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is criminal vehicular homicide the same as murder?",
          "a": "No. Criminal vehicular homicide is a separate offense that specifically involves the operation of a motor vehicle. It is still a very serious felony that can result in substantial prison time and long-term consequences, but it is distinct from intentional homicide or murder charges."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do I automatically go to prison if I am charged?",
          "a": "A charge is not a conviction. While criminal vehicular homicide carries the possibility of a lengthy prison sentence, the outcome depends on the facts of your case, your prior record, how the incident is charged, and the strength of your defense. An experienced defense lawyer can often make a significant difference in the result."
        },
        {
          "q": "How does DWI affect a criminal vehicular homicide case?",
          "a": "Allegations of driving while impaired by alcohol or drugs often play a central role in criminal vehicular homicide charges. The state may rely on breath, blood, or urine test results, officer observations, and field sobriety tests. These tests and procedures can be challenged if they were not done correctly or if your rights were violated."
        },
        {
          "q": "What should I do if I am being investigated after a fatal crash?",
          "a": "Do not discuss the incident with law enforcement, insurance companies, or anyone else about what happened before speaking with an attorney. Anything you say may be used against you later. Contact a criminal defense lawyer immediately to protect your rights and guide you through the investigation."

          "a": "In many cases, yes. Some felony convictions allow you to petition the court to restore your firearm rights if enough time has passed and you can show rehabilitation and a good reason for restoration. Other offenses, especially violent or certain domestic-related felonies, may be more difficult or not eligible. We review your criminal history, court records, and current circumstances to determine realistic options."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I own a gun after a domestic assault conviction in Minnesota?",
          "a": "Domestic assault convictions often trigger both state and federal firearm prohibitions. In some situations, you may be able to seek restoration through the court or challenge how the conviction is classified. Because federal law can still apply even if a state court restores your rights, it’s critical to have a lawyer who understands both layers. We look at the exact statute you were convicted under and how it interacts with federal law before taking any steps."
        },
        {
          "q": "What if my gun rights were taken because of an order for protection (OFP) or DANCO?",
          "a": "Orders for protection and domestic abuse no-contact orders (DANCOs) can temporarily restrict your ability to possess firearms. Violations can also lead to new criminal charges. Once the order ends or is modified, you may be able to address firearm restrictions or seek restoration, depending on your full history. We help you understand how the order affects you now and what you can do going forward."
        },
        {
          "q": "What is the difference between state gun rights and federal gun rights?",
          "a": "Minnesota law and federal law do not always line up. You could be eligible to restore your firearm rights under Minnesota law, but still be barred from possessing a firearm under federal law and the NICS background check system. A smart strategy considers both systems together so you don’t unintentionally commit a new crime by possessing a gun when federal law still says you cannot."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do I need a lawyer for a weapons charge like carrying without a permit?",
          "a": "You should. Weapons charges can lead to jail time, a permanent criminal record, and long-term loss of gun rights. Even a first offense for carrying a handgun without a permit can be a gross misdemeanor, and repeat offenses can become felonies. An experienced defense lawyer can challenge the stop, the search, and whether the state can prove every element of the charge."

          "a": "A Domestic Abuse No-Contact Order (DANCO) is a court order prohibiting any contact   direct or indirect   with the alleged victim in a domestic-related case. This includes texts, calls, social media, being physically near them, or communication through third parties. Only a judge can modify or remove a DANCO, even if the alleged victim wants contact."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can I be charged if the alleged victim contacted me first?",
          "a": "Yes. The law places the responsibility entirely on the defendant   not the alleged victim. Even if they call you, text you, ask to meet, or say the order is 'being lifted,' you can still be arrested and charged. This is one of the most common and frustrating situations we see."
        },
        {
          "q": "Is a DANCO violation a felony?",
          "a": "It depends on your history. A first-time violation is a misdemeanor (up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine). One prior within 10 years makes the new charge a gross misdemeanor (up to one year in jail and a $3,000 fine). Two or more priors within 10 years make it a felony (up to 5 years in prison and a $10,000 fine)."
        },
        {
          "q": "How can the state prove a DANCO violation?",
          "a": "These cases are often proven through recorded jail calls, text messages, screenshots, phone logs, social media communication, witness reports, or police observation. Because the evidence is often digital, prosecutors move fast   and mistakes are common. We review every detail for weaknesses and unlawful police actions."
        },
        {
          "q": "Can a DANCO be modified or removed?",
          "a": "Yes, but only by a judge. Your attorney can file a motion to modify the order, which may allow contact, limited contact, or contact regarding children. The alleged victim cannot remove the order themselves."
        },
        {
          "q": "What should I do if I accidentally violated the order?",
          "a": "Stop all communication and call an attorney immediately. Do not send follow-up messages, explanations, or apologies   these will be used against you. Fast legal action can often prevent additional consequences, negotiate your release, or begin modifying the order."

Police are dispatched, statements are taken, and someone is often arrested or removed from the home. The decision about whether to arrest is made by officers on the scene not the alleged victim  and mandatory arrest policies mean that officers often err on the side of making an arrest. Andrew helps you understand what those first minutes and hours mean for your case. He reviews police reports, body camera footage, and 911 recordings to identify inconsistencies, self-defense issues, and overreactions that can change the outcome of a domestic assault charge."

That’s why it is critical to work with a defense lawyer who knows how to calculate guideline exposure, identify grounds for departures or variances, and argue for the lowest possible sentence or fight for a dismissal or acquittal where the evidence allows."
